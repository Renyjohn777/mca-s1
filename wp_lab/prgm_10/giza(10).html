The Great Pyramid of Giza is a colossal ancient tomb built for Pharaoh Khufu around 2500 BCE, serving as the last standing wonder of the ancient world. Located near modern Cairo, Egypt, it is the largest of the three pyramids at Giza and features internal chambers, including the King's Chamber with a granite sarcophagus. Constructed from 2.3 million limestone blocks, its construction and engineering remain a subject of ongoing study and fascination for historians and scientists.
